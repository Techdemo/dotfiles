# Marcel Fleuren bashprofile
a first attempt at creating my own dot files. It's a start and I plan to make some further adjustments in the further. For example: I want to write some scripts for setting up a work environment in HTML/CSS. 

## Things I added to my bashprofile 

* I've added some simple aliasses to enhance workflow 
* I've added aliasses to toggle on/off my wi-fi 
* Installed Homebrew and installed [shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify). Now I can type the alias **awesome** and *Living in America* by *James Brown* comes blasting through my laptop speakers. 
* Added a rocket and colourized my command line prompt.
